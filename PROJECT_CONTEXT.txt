SEO Content Agent - Project Context (Short)
Last updated: 2026-02-27

1) Project Goal
Build an end-to-end SEO content writing workflow that:
- takes a search query,
- gets top relevant article URLs (or user/AI-citation provided URLs),
- extracts and summarizes competitor content,
- performs SEO gap analysis,
- generates a new article draft,
- exports output (currently local markdown; Google Docs/Sheets planned).

2) What We Confirmed
- Yes, this workflow can be built with Codex.
- Search API can be skipped initially to reduce cost by using:
  - seed URLs,
  - AI citations,
  - AI overview text.
- Web extraction should be deterministic first (trafilatura/HTML parsing), LLM as analysis/writing layer.
- Queue/scheduler can be self-built in project.

3) Current Implementation (Done)
- FastAPI backend created.
- Simple frontend page created for running workflow from browser.
- Pipeline implemented:
  source collection -> URL filtering -> extraction -> per-article summary -> SEO analysis -> article writing -> local export.
- Local export writes markdown files to exports/.
- In-memory run tracking implemented.
- Basic scheduler scaffold added.
- Basic Auth login gate added for public deployment access control
  (APP_LOGIN_USER + APP_LOGIN_PASSWORD).

4) Current Model Profile (Low Cost)
- SMALL_MODEL=gpt-5-mini
- ANALYST_MODEL=gpt-5-mini
- WRITER_MODEL=gpt-5

5) Important Files
- README.md
- app/main.py
- app/workflows/run_pipeline.py
- frontend/index.html
- .env

6) Run Locally
- Activate venv and install requirements.
- Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set in .env.
- Start: uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
- Open: http://localhost:8000

7) Hosting Guidance Discussed
Beginner-friendly path:
1. Run locally first.
2. Push to GitHub.
3. Deploy to Render/Railway with:
   - Build: pip install -r requirements.txt
   - Start: uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT

8) Next Recommended Upgrades
- Add real Google Docs + Google Sheets API export.
- Replace in-memory store with Postgres.
- Add Redis queue/worker and retries.
- Add cost/log monitoring and human review gate before publishing.
- Move from shared Basic Auth to per-user auth (Supabase/Auth) for SaaS accounts.

9) Note for Future Codex Sessions
Ask Codex at start of new thread:
"Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.txt first, then continue from current state."
This helps preserve continuity across threads.
