SEO Content Agent - Project Context (Short)
Last updated: 2026-02-27

1) Project Goal
Build an end-to-end SEO content writing workflow that:
- takes a search query,
- uses top URLs from seed/citations/overview text,
- extracts and summarizes competitor content,
- performs SEO gap analysis,
- generates a better article draft,
- stores results per user account for later access.

2) Core Decisions
- Build fully with Codex + OpenAI APIs.
- Keep search cost low initially by using seed URLs / AI citations / AI overview input.
- Use deterministic extraction first, then LLM for analysis/writing.
- Use simple queue/scheduler in app for retries.

3) Current Implementation (Done)
- FastAPI backend with pipeline:
  source collection -> filtering -> extraction -> per-URL summary -> SEO analysis -> writing -> local export.
- Proper auth system added (not browser basic auth):
  - register/login/logout/me APIs
  - session cookie auth
- Persistent SQLite storage added:
  - users
  - sessions
  - runs
  - run inputs
  - run artifacts
- Per-user dashboard implemented:
  - login page
  - run creation form
  - run history list per user
  - reopen past runs
- Progress tracking implemented:
  - stage label + percent progress while run is processing.
- Scheduler updated to retry queued runs.

4) Current Low-Cost Model Profile
- SMALL_MODEL=gpt-5-mini
- ANALYST_MODEL=gpt-5-mini
- WRITER_MODEL=gpt-5

5) Important Files

- Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY exists in .env.
- Start server:
  python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
- Open:
  http://127.0.0.1:8000

7) Deployment Status
- GitHub repo connected and pushed.
- Render deployment created.
- Custom subdomain connected.
- SSL certificate issued.

8) Next Recommended Upgrades
- Move SQLite to Postgres (production durability).
- Add Redis worker queue for heavier usage.
- Add Google Docs + Sheets export.
- Add Stripe subscriptions and usage limits.
- Add team/org support.

9) Note for Future Codex Sessions
At thread start, say:
"Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.txt first, then continue from current state."
